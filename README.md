# Customer REST API with Spring WebFlux

The service will run on port 8090. Here some endpoints you can call:

**- Send Customer list with JSON format [(i.e attached customers.json)](/customers.json) and return it back sorted by `duetime`:**

`POST /customers/getByDueTimeAsc`

**- Get information about system health and the service itself:**

`GET /actuator/health`

`GET /actuator/info`

(Only those two endpoints are intentionally enabled using Spring Boot Actuator)

---------------

**- Testing with WebFluxTest and WebTestClient:**

Launch the test `testPostAndReadCustomersStatusOk` on the CustomerControllerTest 
to check that the code works sending a dummy single Customer JSON. 

**- Load Testing with JMeter:**

The API has been tested with some basic thread groups requests using JMeter.  The request body is the [attached customers.json](/customers.json)  
From lower to greater tests (There is also a folder named "jmeter" with the results in the project)

a) The lowest test:  
- Number of Threads (users): 25  
- Ramp-up period (seconds): 1  
- Loop Count: 1

**Bonus point answer/conclusion**  
I don't think there is one better than the other, as far I know:
- Testing controller: Maybe I am wrong, but you test it as a Web Application, using a Spring Context. (Integration Test)
- Testing service directly: You need something like Mockito, and then you are not using a Spring Context. (Unit test)
